Space Remover removes any leading or trailing spaces from your post and page content. Securing a clean and consistent website layout.

== Description ==

Space Remover helps keeping your web page design clean and consistent by removing any leading and/ or trailing spaces from your page content. 


The WordPress editor is awesome, but often unintended lines (actually paragraphs) are left at the beginning and /or end of your content. This can be handy , but all to often results in large white spaces in your layout. This simple plugin will remove these lines, helping you get rid of those extra spaces before and after your content without you having to worry about it. 

Because of the simplicity of this plugin there are just a few settings:

- Enable or disable Space Remover to remove all leading and trailing spaces
- Enable Space Remover for removing only leading spaces
- Enable Space Remover for removing only trailing spaces
- NEW! enable/disable the admin metabox

Extra: 
Sometimes you want to use that extra space in your content. For this purpose you can also disable Space Remover on a page/ post individual basis.

UPDATE:
Version 2.0 adds Custom Post Type Support and an extra option to disable the admin (edit page) metabox!

UPDATE 2:
Tested in WP version 4.7 Still going strong!

UPDATE 3:
Tested in WP version 4.7.4 No stopping us!
